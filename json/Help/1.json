"content":"If you're finding that you start your program, do some things with your database, end your program and then go and check that your database has changed, but it hasn't, then this should be helpful. <br><br> If you've set up your database as explained in a tutorial on this website, then you will have a database file (.mdf) representing your database <br><br> <img src=\"images//Help//DatabaseWontChange2.png\"> <br><br> So, what Visual Studio does, every time you click Run (Debug) it copies all of the files it needs to a sub-directory, (/bin/Debug) If you navigate to this directory you should see your database has been copied in there.  <br><br> <img src=\"images//Help//DatabaseWontChange1.png\"> <br><br> The problem that you may be having is that your program is changing the database file inside /bin/Debug, and you're looking for the changes in the first database file we mentioned (in your project folder) <br><br> Now, to make this a little more annoying, the current setup of your project probably copies your datababase file (from your project folder) back into your /bin/Debug folder every time you hit run, so we can avoid this by switching the option on our database file from 'Copy always' to 'Copy if newer' or 'Do not copy' <br><br> <img src=\"images//Help//DatabaseWontChange3.png\"> <br><br> Then, you can change the database you are targetting by going to: <br><br> <pre>Server Explorer > Data Connections > ExampleDatabase.mdf (right click) > Modify Connection... > Browse</pre><br><b>Make sure to switch back to the first database if you want to make changes like adding/modifying tables!</b>"
