This is useful because we don't need to have a label beside our TextBox to tell the user what it's for. <br><br>The first step is to create a Custom User Control in your project: <br><br> <p><img style=\"width:450px\" src=\"Custom1.png\"></p> <br> Since, in our example, we are making a type of TextBox, we will change our custom control to inherit from a TextBox, instead of a UserControl: <pre style=\"float:left;margin-top:20px;width:100%;\"> <code style=\"font-family:monospace\">public partial class HintTextBox : TextBox</code> </pre> <br> After this we just need to add code to store the Hint, and add listeners to determine when to display the hint","example":"public partial class HintTextBox : TextBox\n{\n    string _Hint = \"\";\n    public string Hint\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            return _Hint;\n        }\n        set\n        {\n            _Hint = value;\n            if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(this.Text))\n            {\n                this.Text = value;\n                this.ForeColor = Color.Gray;\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    public HintTextBox()\n    {\n        InitializeComponent();\n        this.GotFocus += gotFocus;\n        this.LostFocus += lostFocus;\n    }\n\n    private void gotFocus(Object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        if(ForeColor == Color.Gray)\n        {\n            ForeColor = Color.Black;\n            Text = \"\";\n        }\n    }\n\n    private void lostFocus(Object sender, EventArgs e)\n    {\n        if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(Text))\n        {\n            Text = Hint;\n            ForeColor = Color.Gray;\n        }\n    }\n}","extra":""}
