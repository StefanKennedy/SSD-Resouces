{"heading":"Performing JOINs in SQL","explains":{},"exampleDescription":"JOINs involve two or more tables, being joined based on a common field. <br> <br>The two tables that we will join are represented as follows, Table 1: <br> <br> <p><img src=\"joinTable1.png\"></p> and Table 2: <br> <br> <p><img src=\"joinTable2.png\"></p> For this example, lets say we want to get all information about <b>receipts</b>. We could SELECT * from receipts, but then the only data we get about the customer is the CustomerID. To include all the information we can use a JOIN:","example":"SELECT * FROM Receipts JOIN Customers ON Receipts.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID","extra":"Which produces the following output: <br> <br> <p><img src=\"joinTable3.png\"></p> To remove the duplicated <b>CustomerID</b> column you can specify the columns to select, eg. SELECT Receipts.ReceiptID, Receipts.Cost, Customers.CustomerID, Customers.Name FROM ..."}
