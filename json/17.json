If you create a new form, you can generate this display. If you navigate to the Data Sources window, you can choose what kind of auto generated controls you want: <br> <br> <img src=\"Report1.jpeg\"> <br> <br> If you drag this data source onto a form, it should generate controls that create the report functionality for you: <br> <br> <img src=\"Report2.jpeg\"> <br> <br> As long as this contains the information that the user wants to see, you can use this as the form for this table"}
